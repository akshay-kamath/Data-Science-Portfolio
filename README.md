* __[YOLO for Object Detection](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/YOLO_Object_Detection_from_Scratch.ipynb)__: Built a YOLO object detection model from scratch in TensorFlow 2.x

---
### Time-series Analysis:

* __[Automatic Speech Recognition](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis/Automatic_Speech_Recognition.ipynb)__: This project demonstrates how to build and train a basic ASR model using TensorFlow, Keras and the LJSpeech dataset. The model uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRUs) to transcribe speech into text.
* __[Time Series Analysis & Forecasting](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Time-Series-with-Python)__: This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of projects focused on time series analysis and forecasting. It covers a wide range of techniques, from fundamental statistical methods to more advanced deep learning models, applied to real-world datasets to uncover trends, seasonality and make accurate predictions.
----
### Data Visualization:

* __[Immigrants to Canada data visualization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Visualizing%20Global%20Migration%20to%20Canada.ipynb)__: An in-depth data visualization project exploring global migration patterns to Canada from 1980 to 2013, utilizing a diverse set of Python libraries to uncover key trends and insights.
*  __[Geospatial visualization of San Francisco Police Department Incidents](https://nbviewer.org/github/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Geospatial%20visualization%20of%20San%20Francisco%20incidents.ipynb)__: A geospatial analysis of San Francisco Police Department incidents from 2016. This project leverages the Folium library to create an interactive map that visualizes the density and distribution of incidents across the city.

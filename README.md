## Machine Learning: ##

### Supervised Learning

### Regression
* __[Automobile price prediction](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning/Regression/Automobile%20Price%20Prediction%20%20.ipynb)__: Developed a complete end-to-end data science pipeline in Python to predict the prices of pre-owned automobiles using machine learning algorithms and a comprehensive set of features.
----
### Unsupervised Learning 
* __[Data-Driven Anomaly Detection for Sales](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Anomaly_detection/tree/master)__: Developed a full stack anomaly detection system that uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to analyze sales data and provide visualizations and insights for sales strategy optimization.

----
## Deep Learning 

### Natural Language Processing:

* __[Sequential Sentence Classification](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Sequential-sentence-classification)__: Developed a deep learning model for sequential sentence classification to automatically convert "hard-to-read" text into simplified, easier-to-read text.
* __[Sentiment Analysis with BERT](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/sentiment_analysis_with_bert.py)__: End to end sentiment analysis on the IMDb dataset using BERT-based models covering preprocessing, training, evaluation and optimized deployment with ONNX.
* __[Intent Classification for Customer Service](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/intent_classification_for_customer_service.py)__: Built an intent classifier for customer support chatbots using DeBERTa trained on real world conversational datasets.
* __[Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Named_entity_recognition_using_huggingface_transformers.py)__: Fine tuned a RoBERTa model on the CoNLL-2003 dataset to identify entities like people, organizations and locations in text.
* __[Neural Machine Translation (English â†’ French)](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Neural_machine_translation.py)__: Fine-tuned a T5-small model to translate English sentences into French evaluated with BLEU scores.
* __[Extractive Question Answering](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing/Extractive_question_answering.py)__: Implemented a Longformer-based QA system that extracts precise answers from long documents using datasets like covid_qa_deepset.
----
### Computer Vision: 

* __[Visual Privacy Protection](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Visual-Privacy-protection)__: An AI based application designed to protect visual privacy by anonymizing faces and obfuscating sensitive textual information (PII) in both images and videos.
* __[YOLO for Object Detection](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Computer%20Vision/YOLO_Object_Detection_from_Scratch.ipynb)__: Built a YOLO object detection model from scratch in TensorFlow 2.x

---
### Time-series Analysis:

* __[Automatic Speech Recognition](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Analysis/Automatic_Speech_Recognition.ipynb)__: This project demonstrates how to build and train a basic ASR model using TensorFlow, Keras and the LJSpeech dataset. The model uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi-GRUs) to transcribe speech into text.
* __[Time Series Analysis & Forecasting](https://github.com/akshay-kamath/Time-Series-with-Python)__: This repository showcases a comprehensive collection of projects focused on time series analysis and forecasting. It covers a wide range of techniques, from fundamental statistical methods to more advanced deep learning models, applied to real-world datasets to uncover trends, seasonality and make accurate predictions.
----
### Data Visualization:

* __[Immigrants to Canada data visualization](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/akshay-kamath/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Visualization/Visualizing%20Global%20Migration%20to%20Canada.ipynb)__: An in-depth data visualization project exploring global migration patterns to Canada from 1980 to 2013, utilizing a diverse set of Python libraries to uncover key trends and insights.

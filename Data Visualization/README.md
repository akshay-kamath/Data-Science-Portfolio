# Data Visualization Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis and visualization projects created using Python. The projects highlight skills in data manipulation, exploratory data analysis, and advanced data visualization techniques, demonstrating the ability to turn complex datasets into clear, compelling, and actionable insights.

## Project 1: Immigration to Canada Data Visualization

An in-depth analysis of immigration data to Canada from 1980 to 2013. This project demonstrates comprehensive data wrangling and the creation of diverse plot types to explore trends, patterns, and demographic shifts over time.

### Key Highlights:

*   Utilized `pandas` and `NumPy` for data cleaning and preparation.
*   Created various static plots (Bar Charts, Line Plots, Area Plots, Histograms, and Box Plots) using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
*   Developed interactive choropleth maps with `Folium` to visualize global immigration flows.
*   Uncovered and visualized key insights on top immigrant source countries and historical immigration waves.

### Dataset Details:

*   **Source:** The dataset, "International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision," is from the United Nations.
*   **Content:** It contains annual data on international immigrant flows to Canada.
*   **Time Period:** The data covers the years 1980 to 2013.

## Project 2: Spatial Visualization of San Francisco Incidents

A geospatial data visualization project focusing on San Francisco Police Department incidents in 2016. This notebook showcases the power of interactive mapping to explore and understand the spatial distribution of events.

### Key Highlights:

*   Employed `Folium` to create a highly detailed, interactive map of San Francisco.
*   Implemented marker clusters to effectively manage and display thousands of data points without cluttering the map.
*   Provided a clear visual representation of incident density and locations throughout the city.

### Dataset Details:

*   **Source:** The data is "Police Department Incidents for the year 2016" from the San Francisco public data portal.
*   **Content:** The data is derived from the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) Crime Incident Reporting system, with anonymized addresses and locations.
*   **Time Period:** The dataset covers the entire year of 2016.
